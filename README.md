# CubeRoyale

An experimental battle royale game based on Cube 2 (Sauerbraten) engine inspired by Fortnite.

I'm developing this game just for fun and to play with this nice engine. The game is actually unplayable and probably it will ever be so.

I took some content also from redeclipse and tesseract (games always based on the same engine).
